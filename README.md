# Mucking about with JVM

## Installation

Download the `sootclasses-trunk-jar-with-dependencies.jar` file and save as `soot.jar` from https://soot-build.cs.uni-paderborn.de/public/origin/master/soot/soot-master/3.3.0/build/.

Run:

```bash
$ ./gradlew jimple
```

and hopefully jimple files will show up in `sootOutput/`.
